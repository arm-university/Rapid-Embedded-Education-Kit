# 1 Introduction

# 1.1	Lab overview
We have already met Timers in previous module 6 (Interrupts). Hardware timers underpin the `Ticker` and `Timeout` types as well are RTOS scheduling (see module 10). Hardware timers are also used with sequential code, and this is what we are going to look at here.

`PwmOut` was also used back in module 7 as a way to generate a mean DC output. This is also underpinned by hardware timers.

In this lab, we will design an audio player that will play a melody saved beforehand. The volume of the music as well as its speed can be controlled by two buttons. By the end of this lab you will get some insight and practical experience with the Mbed API for Timers and Tickers.

# 2 Requirements

In this lab, we will be using the following software and hardware:

- **Mbed Studio**, an IDE designed to streamline development and prototyping using Mbed enabled microcontrollers and development boards: https://os.mbed.com/studio/

    **OR**

    **Keil Studio**, which can be found here: https://studio.keil.arm.com/auth/login/
  

- **NUCLEO-F401RE**, or another suitable Mbed OS 6 compatible development board. A full list of compatible devices can be found here: https://os.mbed.com/platforms, note that outputs may have to be reconfigured for devices following a different standard.

* A breadboard, 2 x 100Ω resistors, 2 x 10kΩ potentiometers, 1 x speaker (ABI-001-RC), 3 x RGB LED.

The code skeleton, which includes some support for implementing the task in [section 5.1](#51-Define-the-Music-Note-and-Beat-Length), [section 5.2](#52-Your-Application-Code) should be found in the same folder as this manual.

# 3 Hardware Setup

## 3.1 Pin Layout [TO BE CHANGED]

In this experiment, we are going to use the Nucleo F401RE board. The pin descriptions for the board can be found below:

On a breadboard, build the circuit in Figure 2, using the hardware components listed in section [“2. Requirements”](#2-Requirements):

On a breadboard, connect the 2 buttons according to the diagram on the left.  Your buttons should pull the GPIO pin low. 

Then connect the buttons, the RGB LEDs and the speaker to their respective pin on the board as defined in the table below. 

| Pin | Pin name in Mbed API |
| - | - |
| Button 1 | D4 |
| Button 2 | D7 |
| PWM speaker | D3 |
| RED LED | D5 |
| Green LED | D6 |
| Blue LED | D9 |

# Software Interfaces

## 4.1 Timer Interface
We can use the timer interface to create, start, stop and read a timer for measuring precise times (better than millisecond precision), for example:
```C++
Timer t;
 
int main() {
    t.start();
    printf("Hello World!\n");
    t.stop();
    printf("The time taken was %f seconds\n", t.read());
}
```

You can independently create, start and stop any number of Timer objects simultaneously. The member functions of the API can be found in [section 4.3](#43-Software-Functions).

# 4.2	Ticker interface

We can use the Ticker interface to set up a recurring interrupt; it calls a function repeatedly and at a specified rate, for example:

```C++
Ticker flipper;
DigitalOut led1(LED1);
DigitalOut led2(LED2);
 
void flip() {
    led2 = !led2;
}
 
int main() {
    led2 = 1;
    flipper.attach(&flip, 2.0); // the address of the function to be attached (flip) and the interval (2 seconds)
 
    // spin in a main loop. flipper will interrupt it to call flip
    while(1) {
        led1 = !led1;
        wait(0.2);
    }
}
```

You can create any number of Ticker objects, allowing multiple outstanding interrupts at the same time. The function can be a static function, a member function of a particular object or a Callback object. This can be done using the member functions of this API which can be found in [section 4.3](#43-Software-Functions).

# 4.3 PWM


# 4.4 Software functions

You can find in the table below the member function of the Timer Interface and Ticker interface which were introduced in this lab, as well as some member function of the PwmOut Interface which will be helpful for this lab.

# 5 Designing an Audio Player

In this lab task, you will design an audio player that uses a timer, PWM, and interrupts.

## 5.1 Define the Music Note and Beat Length
To play music, it is better to define a list of notes that maybe used to play the music, including the music notes (the frequency of the sound, e.g. do, re, mi, fa, so, la, si) and the beat length (the time that the current note lasts for, such as whole note, half note). To do that, you need to adjust the period of the PWM so that it can produce a correct frequency for each music note, and the period of play to produce the desired beat.
After defining the music note and beat length, you can then make a note array which will produce a simple piece of music, for example the following sheet gives the notes and beats of “Jingle bells”

<figure>
<img src="../../Materials/img/Module_8_jingle-bells-4-bar.png" width="400px">
<figcaption>Figure 3: jingle bells 4 bar</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
<img src="../../Materials/img/Module_8_jingle-bells-4-bar-2.png" width="400px">
<figcaption>Figure 4: jingle bells 4 bar 2</figcaption>
</figure>

In this first task, on the skeleton code, you should:
* Define a basic musique note, for example:
```C++
# define Do		0.5
# define Re		0.45
# define Mi		0.4
# define Fa		0.36
# define So     0.33
# define La     0.31
# define Si     0.3
# define No		0
```

* Define a basic beat note, for example:
```C++
# define b1		0.5		//whole note
# define b2		0.25		//half note
…
```

* Define a basic beat note, for example:
```C++
float note []={ Mi,  No,  Mi …
float beat [] ={ b3,  b3,  b3 …
…
```

# 5.2	Application code
In this task, you will be completing the code skeleton using the functions presented in [section 4.3](#43-Software-Functions). You can make use of the following guidelines:
* Define the digital inputs (two buttons) and PWM outputs (speaker and LEDs)
* Define the time ticker
* Write the time ticker ISR, which will be periodically triggered after each single music note 
    - Update the PWM frequency to the next music note
    - Update the beat length for the next music note (reconfigure the tick interrupt time)
    - Update the brightness of the LEDs to reflect the melody change
        - The red LED intensity should represent the note being played.
        - The green LED intensity should represent the beat’s length.
        - The blue LED intensity should represent the volume. It also should blink at the same speed of the melody.
    -	The input of the first button will be used to adjust the volume to 80% when it is pressed and 20% when it is not,
    -	The input of the second button will be used to adjust the speed of the song by adding a delay of 0.5 seconds when the button is pressed.
*	In the main program
    -	Initialize the time ticker
    -	Sleep and wait for interrupts
