## About

Welcome to our Rapid Embedded Systems Design Education Kit!

Our flagship offering to universities worldwide is the Arm University Program Education Kit series.

These self-contained educational materials offered exclusively and at no cost to academics and teaching staff worldwide. They’re designed to support your day-to-day teaching on core electronic engineering and computer science subjects. You have the freedom to choose which modules to teach – you can use all the modules in the Education Kit or only those that are most appropriate to your teaching outcomes.

Our Rapid Embedded Systems Design Education Kit covers the fundamental principles of how to accelerate the development of embedded systems and rapidly prototype various embedded applications. A full description of the education kit can be found [here](https://www.arm.com/resources/education/education-kits/rapid-embedded-systems). 

## Mbed Announcement

Arm has announced the End of Life Timeline for Mbed. The Arm Education team is actively working on creating alternative teaching and learning solutions in time for the new academic terms starting Fall/Autumn 2025. We welcome feedback from the academic community on this. Reach out to the team at: education@arm.com

## Inclusive Language Commitment
Arm is committed to making the language we use inclusive, meaningful, and respectful. Our goal is to remove and replace non-inclusive language from our vocabulary to reflect our values and represent our global ecosystem.
 
Arm is working actively with our partners, standards bodies, and the wider ecosystem to adopt a consistent approach to the use of inclusive language and to eradicate and replace offensive terms. We recognise that this will take time. This course contains references to non-inclusive language; it will be updated with newer terms as those terms are agreed and ratified with the wider community. 
 
Contact us at education@arm.com with questions or comments about this course. You can also report non-inclusive and offensive terminology usage in Arm content at terms@arm.com.

------------------------------

In this material, we use the terms ‘Controller’ and 'Target' in the context of the the I2C and SPI protocols, instead of the terms ‘Master’ and ‘Slave’, which were conventionally used until recently. As a result, the related concepts of 'MISO' and 'MOSI' become 'CITO' and 'COTI'.
